# GPMS-Blockchain
A blockchain based solution for monitoring government project activities built using Smart Contracts written in Solidity. This project was developed at the Global Blockchain Hackathon. The system aims to help an organization (government in this case) to manage updates regarding projects which involves coordination of multiple departments.
<br><br>
The system assumes three types of users: admin, officer and operator.
<br>The operator of each department is responsible for putting out updates regarding the project. The operator has restricted privileges and can only add updates.
<br>The officer assumes the role of making sure whether correct updates are being put out. Any update made by the operator will be verified by 3 officers.
<br>Finally, the admin has the right to create new projects, add departments, close projects and monitor updates.
<br>The system maintains the hierarchial nature of an organization at the same time decentralizes the process making coordination between different departments easier.
<br>The system also intends to provide the citizens of the nation with actual updates regarding government activities.
